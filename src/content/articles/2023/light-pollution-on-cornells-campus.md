Light pollution is often one of the more overlooked forms of pollution in the world. It is often not seen as a real or dangerous form of pollution because we can’t immediately see the effects like polluted waters or air quality. Instead, it is far more sinister. Unnecessary outdoor artificial light at night (ALAN) negatively affects both human and animal behaviors. As of a 2016 study by the International Dark Sky Association, 80 percent of the world’s population live in an area with polluted night skies. In the United States and Europe, 99% of people don’t have access to experience the natural light of dark skies. Since then, our night skies have only gotten brighter and we can see less and less of the stars our ancestors used to tell stories. According to darkskys.org and Science Direct, within the last 200 years, our night skies have become a thousand times brighter and over 50% of our current light pollution is caused by streetlights.

Due to the increase in ALAN, National Geographic reports that there has been a significant decrease in the amount of necessary melatonin in the human body that allows us to operate on a proper circadian rhythm. With the disruptive artificial light, our natural night and day cycle is unable to properly function the way we need it to be healthy. As a result, sleep deprivation, headaches, stress, anxiety and other health problems are more likely to become apparent.

Being removed from larger cities, Cornell’s campus should be a prime area to see the night skies without polluted light. However, the school’s use of unshielded or partially shielded lighting around campus interferes with the natural brightness of the sky. Illuminating the sky with unshielded light no longer serves its purpose of lighting the ground, instead most of the light creates a glow around it and causes more harm than good. The spherical lighting fixtures around the campus are some of the best examples of how unshielded light fixtures affect light pollution. Because the light has a way to escape everywhere, a lot of the light travels upward, illuminating the sky rather than lighting the ground like it is supposed to.

Having a dark sky doesn’t mean the ground has to be dark. Installing shields for lights is the main proposition of many programs seeking to create darker skies. Shielding light fixtures illuminates the ground instead of the sky above. Shielding lights around Cornell’s campus would create a perfect place to view the vibrance of the night sky.

Although shielding lights greatly reduces the amount of light pollution artificial lights produce, the best way to prevent unnecessary ALAN is to implement motion sensors. This reduces the usage of lights around campus that are unneeded during all hours of night.

Protecting our night skies are not just important to the casual stargazer, astronomer, poet, or artist, but incredibly vital to our health and safety. Taking steps to create darker skies at Cornell College can not only allow students to receive melatonin, but create a closer community under darker skies.
