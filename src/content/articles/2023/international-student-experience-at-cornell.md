Have you experienced culture shock? International students encounter new cultures every day at Cornell. I asked new students from Nepal, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Japan to answer a survey about culture shock. What kind of culture shock have they experienced so far?

First, is food. For the students who grew up outside the US, the food here is too big, salty, or sweet. Although the Hilltop cafeteria provides international food, international students would like to have “real food” from their cultures.

Second, is how people interact with each other. The interaction between people is different in each culture. For international students, people in the US interact through more verbal than nonverbal communication.

Third, is the lecture style. Many classes at Cornell require students to participate in the class actively. However, in many countries outside of the US, students are not allowed to speak up freely. They need to focus on listening to lectures and taking notes instead. Therefore, the lecture style at Cornell, in which students talk about many different topics freely, is new to them.

These are just a few examples. International students have been experiencing unique things more every moment at Cornell. Next, let’s take a look at the cultural events at Cornell that they found interesting.

For some students, the International Students Orientation was an interesting cultural event. International students have been getting a lot of support from the school and upper-class students. They had the orientation about culture shock, predominantly white institutions, micro aggression, and so on. Those orientations helped students get used to the campus life at Cornell.

Other students answered that the events of cultural groups, such as Gente and BACO make a good cultural experience at Cornell. These groups hold many events where students can get to know about different cultures through fun activities such as dance, art, and food.

Finally, these students told the activities related to their cultures they would like to do at Cornell. Most students answered that they would like to have events where they can introduce the food of their cultures. Others answered that they would like to have events about the history and culture of Cornell and Mount Vernon.

As we can see, different cultures are everywhere at Cornell. Some events can be experienced by not only international students but also students from the US. Let’s participate in these events and gain new cultural experiences while you are at Cornell!
