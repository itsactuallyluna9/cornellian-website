COVID-19 has been rough for everyone and has drastically changed everyone’s lives whether you are a school-aged child whose school was moved to be fully online, a working adult who was laid off or forced to move to work-from-home, or a retired elder who was are at high risks of losing their life due to the virus. It has drastically affected everyone’s daily life.

I and many other freshmen were affected by COVID-19 in many different ways but we all shared the same collective experience of our first time in college. Our very first experience in college is very much different than in previous years before us.

The college experience has the name of being the best years of our lives from fraternities/ sororities parties to making new friends, having late-night sleepovers with friends, and in all having face mask-free days. All things that I, as a freshman in college, in my first semester of college and many other freshmen couldn’t experience and having to rebuild our version of college with a pandemic and revamping the college experience myth.

I came into college with the hope of getting independence and of trying to escape from my comfort zones with the mentality of living each day like a new one but it gets difficult to do so with having limitations with what I can or can’t do with the safety restrictions in order to keep our Cornell community safe.

I had to adjust my mindset of knowing that the college experience isn’t going to be like any of the previous years before me with being one of the only generations to be starting college during a pandemic.

I had to adjust my mindset to knowing and understanding that my experience wasn’t going to be like the college experience myth.  
My first semester of college was spent with most of my day in my dorm by myself following the Cornell guidelines and with spending so much time in my dorm by myself, I was able to pick up painting as a hobby for times I get extremely stressed and or overwhelmed and for when I reached a whole new level of boredom.

I also picked up an interest in creating different forms of media whether it is exploring different types of writing, editing videos, working with audio, and exploring digital design.

Being in my dorm for the majority of the day led to a lot of loss of motivation and just in all a will to do nothing for days and sometimes weeks without being able to get inspiration from the people around me, it left me feeling a sense of hopelessness.

It was a struggle and knowing that my experience wouldn’t be like the “college experiences” And for the next semester, I know that it will be harder for me to come out of my shell with the safety restrictions that Cornell has in place to reduce the spread of the virus.

My experience with being a freshman in college for the first time in a pandemic has definitely been different. These past three months have been different from everything that I have been told of what college has been told it is supposed to be. I was told that college was supposed to be the best years of my life with being independent, away from my family who also told me how college parties are something that can not be described but has to be experienced for oneself own self with going to fraternities and having late night sleepovers/parties with friends and just, in general, the dating culture that the college experience that I was been told.

Moving forward with my college experience, I plan to find a new way to revamp my college experience that will allow me to come out of my comfort zone while still keeping the community safe from the virus. This is a journey for all of us and something we have all never experienced before, there is a lesson to be learned daily.
