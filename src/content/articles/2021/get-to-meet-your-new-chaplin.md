The Cornell community welcomed a new member, lifelong Iowan Rev. Melea White, to the hilltop this year. I sat down with her to discuss why she chose Cornell, what she hopes to do here, and how she can connect with all students regardless of their background.

**Q: Being a Chaplain of a college certainly has to be a unique position: what led you to choose this over a more traditional church position.**

A: Many of us go into career fields that we have a personal connection to. I was really questioning myself and my beliefs in college. I didn’t know how to make sense of my religious beliefs and my new understanding of the world. I was trying to deal with finding the meaning of life and my purpose.

So I find that I am drawn towards working with college students who are trying to answer all of these same questions, regardless of their religious or spiritual background. College is a great stage of life to be in and work with in terms of the big questions students are asking and self discovery / identity development they’re doing

**Q: \*\***What do you want to do at Cornell?\*\*

A: I am very excited to think about where things might go from here. This first year I imagine I will just be getting a sense of what the community needs for spiritual care.

This is a time when a lot of students’ worldviews are evolving; it is my hope that I can accompany students during a time when students are trying to understand and explore life a bit more deeply.

**Q: What about students that are not very religious? **

A: I want people to know that I am a resource. I can help with the big life questions, trying to find meaning and purpose, as well as religious and spiritual questions or struggles. I want everyone to know that the chaplain is a resource and support regardless of belief (if this second sentence feels too redundant you could remove it).

**Q: What Programs are you currently running? **

A: Some will be ongoing with new events every block.
