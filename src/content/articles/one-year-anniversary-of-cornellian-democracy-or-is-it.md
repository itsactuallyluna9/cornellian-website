To follow up on last year’s reporting on the end to *The Cornellian* dictatorship under the previous executive board, we are happy to provide a status update. Although there has been a “transfer of power,” it has not resulted in what some would agree is an improvement in the state of democracy. The new executive board has enjoyed an endless buffet of snacks as tribute from the writers, while forcing them to attend an absurd number of propaganda meetings all opening with a cult-like question of the week provided by The Court Jester. 

Responding to these concerns, *The Cornellian*’s business controller Eliza Carlson said “I only want to leave as much chaos in my wake as possible.” Even more concerning, co-editor Murray Page stated (while smiling) that “there should be no worry, everything we do is just for the gruesome downfall of our writers, who we appreciate very much.” Anti-violence co-editor James Belding added that “I’m just in it for the snacks.” 

Luckily, the staff writers have managed to overthrow one of these dictators. It was said that Carlson was on track to never graduate, but one night President Brand was mysteriously persuaded to add Carlson’s name to the senior class. The presence of the entire newspaper staff at such a clandestine midnight meeting to beg for Carlson’s removal is disputed but highly questioned. Page and Belding, the remaining two dictators, look forward to continuing their reign of terror.  

Stay tuned for next year’s update. We hope the newspaper still exists by then.
