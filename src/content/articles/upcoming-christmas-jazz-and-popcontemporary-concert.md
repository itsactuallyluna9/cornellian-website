After the success of their first concert together on Oct. 13th, the Cornell College Jazz and Pop/Contemporary Ensembles are eagerly anticipating their next opportunity to perform.

The upcoming Jazz Ensemble and Pop/Contemporary Ensemble performance will be 7 - 8 p.m. Dec. 15 in Smith Dining Room, Thomas Commons.

According to Jazz Ensemble members Maggie Lee, a Sophomore and percussionist, and Lewis Page, a Junior and guitarist, the set will include a variety of styles of jazz music including swing, latin, blues and more. The well-rounded group is looking forward to performing quite a few Christmas songs. They will also be performing several songs from the last concert. Lee shares that she has many drum solos in this concert that she “has been practicing hard and is very excited for.” Lee and Page both share that there are some freshmen this year that have been doing very well, and that it is great to see the group putting in so much effort. They also state that they “enjoy playing in the same concerts with the Pop/Contemporary ensemble” and that it makes their concerts much more fun.

The Pop/Contemporary Ensemble, new to Cornell’s music department this year, has already been embraced by the students and faculty. Dr. Benjamin Laur, the ensemble’s director, is excited about the major successes of the group so far: high levels of engagement from the students in the group, faculty and staff support, and the positive reception by the student body at the first concert. Practices have continued to evolve and develop since the October concert as well. “It just feels more natural, the rehearsal process now. It feels less like a class and more like we’re getting together and making music.” The setlist, as with the Jazz Ensemble, will cover some Christmas music (“we might be ruining everyone’s Whammaggedon”), but will also include other rock and pop songs as well. Said Dr. Laur, “There might be a Chappell Roan single that was very popular over the summer in this program, I don’t know. Good luck finding out which one. There’s some Foo Fighters. It’s going to be a fun time.”

Both ensembles have been hard at work preparing for their second joint concert of the year. The last concert saw a packed crowd in Smith Dining Room, so for those interested in attending the show, plan to arrive early to get seats! Attendance is free.

Dr. Laur shared that “It was an absolute party in October and I think it will be again.”
