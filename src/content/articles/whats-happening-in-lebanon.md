## What is Lebanon?

Lebanon is a small country in the Middle East, bordered by Syria to the north and east, Israel to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. Its modern borders were established after World War I under a French mandate, leading to independence in 1943. Lebanon’s political system reflects its religious diversity with significant Christian, Sunni Muslim, Shia Muslim, and Druze communities. But, this diversity has also been a source of tension throughout its history. Lebanon’s strategic location and multi-sectarian composition have made it vulnerable to regional conflicts.

## What is happening?

One of the conflicts is currently unfolding between Lebanon’s southern neighbor, Israel, and its political and military force, Hezbollah, which operates independently from the official Lebanese government. On October 20th, 2024, there was a major Israeli airstrike in Lebanon’s capital Beirut that was further followed by Israel’s invasion. So far, the outcomes on both sides of the conflict are:

**In Lebanon:**[^1]<br>
Killed: over 3,768<br>
Injured: 15,699<br>
Displaced: over 1.3 million

**In Israel:**[^2]<br>
Killed: over 60<br>
Displaced: over 60,000

## Why is it happening?

The current tensions are not isolated but part of a long and complex history. The interplay between sectarian divisions, foreign interventions, and unresolved grievances has repeatedly pulled Lebanon into regional conflicts. The escalation of violence in Gaza kindled these old tensions, with Hezbollah playing a key role. If Lebanon becomes more involved, it could lead to humanitarian disasters and further lead to regional war escalation.

## Main actors of the conflict

**Lebanese government:** Officially neutral but struggles to control Hezbollah; the government is weak and fragmented.

**State of Israel:** Seeks to dismantle threats from both Hezbollah and Hamas, views Hezbollah as an extension of Iranian influence and a direct military threat.

**Hezbollah militia:** A political and military force in Lebanon expanded from resistance to governance but is designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the US, and the EU due to its involvement in violence against civilians and other militant activities.

**Iran:** Provides financial, military, and ideological support to Hezbollah, seeing it as a strategic ally to challenge Israeli influence in the region.

## History

### Emergence of Israel, 1948

After Israel’s founding, the First Arab–Israeli War led to the displacement of many Palestinians, known as the Nakba.[^3] Many sought refuge in Lebanon, exacerbating political instability as the refugee population grew but remained without citizenship.[^4]

### Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990

Existing sectarian struggles for political power between Christians, Muslims, and leftist groups escalated into civil war.[^5] During this time, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) started using southern Lebanon as a base to launch attacks against Israel. The war officially ended in 1990 with the Taif Agreement, which adjusted the power-sharing system, but many militias, especially Hezbollah, retained their weapons and influence.[^6] Moreover, Israel was still illegally occupying southern Lebanon.[^7]

### Israeli Occupation, 1982-2000

Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, aiming to expel the PLO.[^8] This led to massacres, such as Sabra and Shatila, where hundreds of Palestinians were killed by Christian militias with Israeli oversight.[^9] Later in 1982, Israel established a security zone it controlled through the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a Lebanese militia allied with Israel.

### Emergence of Hezbollah, 1985

In response to Israel’s occupation, Hezbollah, a Shia resistance group, was formed with backing from Iran and Syria.[^10] Only in 2000, Hezbollah eventually forced Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon, which bolstered Hezbollah’s influence among Lebanese Shia communities. Founded in 1985 as a resistance group, Hezbollah quickly grew into a powerful militia and political party. However, the conflict didn’t stop there.[^11]

### Lebanese War, 2006

The conflict escalated in 2006 when Hezbollah launched a cross-border raid, capturing two Israeli soldiers and killing eight. The militant group also launched a reported 1,300 rockets into predominantly civilian areas in Israel, killing 18 civilians. Israel responded with massive airstrikes and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. Over 1,100 Lebanese (mostly civilians) and 65 Israelis were killed.[^12] The war ended with UN Security Council Resolution 1701, limiting Hezbollah’s military activity near the Israeli border and mandating a ceasefire, with Israeli withdraw from Lebanon and a peacekeeping mission (UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon.[^13] Tensions between Hezbollah and Israel, however, remained unresolved.

### Lebanon’s Crisis, 2019

Lebanon’s economy collapsed, and political gridlock worsened sectarian tensions. Politically, Lebanon became paralyzed, with multiple failed attempts to form a government and sectarian divisions preventing reforms. As a result, Hezbollah’s influence increased as it filled gaps in governance, exerting significant control over parts of the state and challenging the state’s authority.

### Israel-Hamas Conflict, 2023

Escalated violence against Palestinians heightened tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border, with fears that Hezbollah might open a second front against Israel. In October 2023, Hezbollah engaged in cross-border skirmishes with Israel, with reports of missile exchanges. Iran voiced support for Hezbollah, warning of wider consequences if Israel continued its assault on Gaza. The world’s concern increased when Israel used white phosphorus, an unlawful incendiary weapon, in southern Lebanon as cross-border hostilities escalated.[^14]

### Israeli Air Strikes, 2024

In October 2024, Israel targeted a financial center in Beirut, targeting leaders of Hezbollah. After killing the leader of Hezbollah, Israel began a full invasion of Lebanon. The operation led to further displacement, with 800 people forced to flee. Following this, Israel expanded its military campaign, bombing Ghaziyeh, Nabatiyeh, Tyre, and Dahiye, intensifying the conflict.[^15] On October 1st, IDF (Israel Defense Forces) officially crossed the border into Lebanon. Since September, there have been over 1,700 strikes (the report was published on October 4th)[^16] on Lebanon and over 200 rockets launched by Hezbollah (the report was published on October 26th).[^17] Overall, since October 7th, 2023, there were 341 armed clashes, 2,219 Hezbollah strikes, and 11,536 Israel strikes.[^18]

## Why is it important?

**Humanitarian Crisis:** Lebanon is already suffering from political and economic collapse, with its population facing poverty, lack of infrastructure, and insufficient medical resources. New rounds of violence and displacement from Israeli strikes exacerbate these humanitarian concerns, and if conflict widens, Lebanon’s already strained capacity to support its citizens and refugees (from Syria and Palestine) could collapse, leading to large-scale human suffering and displacement.

**Regional Stability and Escalation Risk:** Lebanon’s location at the crossroads of the Middle East makes it a flashpoint for regional power struggles. The conflict between Hezbollah and Israel risks spilling into neighboring countries, with Iran’s support for Hezbollah and Israel’s alliances potentially pulling more states into a broader war. An escalation could destabilize not only Lebanon but the entire region, dragging the whole Middle East into war.

**Global Energy and Economic Implications:** The Middle East plays a critical role in global energy markets. Any disruption in this region can lead to oil price fluctuations and impact international markets, straining economies worldwide, especially those reliant on energy imports.

**International Law and Human Rights:** The conflict raises serious moral and legal questions. Allegations of disproportionate force, civilian casualties, and potential community punishment violate principles of international law. Both Israel and Hezbollah are blamed for endangering civilians. Human rights organizations expressed concerns over international law violations and war crimes committed in the following articles:
