"The Moors" follows the story of two sisters, Agatha (Luci Bransel ‘25) and Huldey (Aniyah Shorter Adams ‘27). The play opens on the day in which a governess, Emilie (Finn Hunter ‘27), comes to stay with them at the request of their older brother Master Branwell. The more time Emilie spends at the Moors, the more she learns how strange the place truly is, from every room looking like the parlor, to Marjorie and Mallory (Elise Zielinski-Gutierrez ‘27) being the same person, and letters from Branwell not being what they appear. Meanwhile, the Mastiff (Sam Luckerman ‘28) who lives with the sisters meets a Moorhen (Ellianna Liljequist ‘28), who while initially scared of the large dog, accepts his friendship. But the Mastiff becomes obsessed with the Moorhen, never wanting to be separated. As the story unfolds, Emilie finds out that it was actually Agatha who wrote the letters and they fall in love. Huldey, however, is jealous of Agatha and the attention she receives from Emilie, and in a plot created by Marjorie/Mallory, kills Agatha. The play ends in a new beginning, Hudley taking over as head of house and the Mastiff, lonely once more having eaten the Moorhen.
From the beginning, the audience is thrown into the dreary, slightly disturbed, world of the Moors. Literally. The unconventional seating arrangement, with the audience on stage rather than in the regular theater seats, allowed for viewers to quite literally be placed in the Moors. This also allowed for the crew to create effects from fog to lightning, using the space where viewers usually sit to create the outside environment of the Moors.

Across the board the actors played their characters well, insighting different reactions and feelings from the audience. Luci’s clipped and quick delivery of lines created a harsh persona that allowed for Agatha’s character development to become clear as the plot progressed. Aniyah’s Huldey was full of light and childlike behavior, leaving room for a sharp contrast from Agatha and a lighthearted and innocent humor that differs from the rest of the play. Finn’s portrayal of Emilie was a constant of normalcy throughout the show, voicing and depicting the typical thoughts going on in the audience’s head about the world that is the Moors. Elise nailed the comedic timing of Marjorie/Mallory, interacting with each character differently and putting a sarcastic spin on the character as she manipulates Huldey and plans for the murder of Agatha. Sam and Ellianna did a great job capturing the unsteady relationship between the Mastiff and Moorhen, making the audience root for the relationship between the two before it becomes slowly unsettling as Sam captures that of an obsessed lover and Ellianna’s acting made the Moorhen’s uncertainty and fear feel real. The acting of all players led to an unforgettable rollercoaster of emotions.

A special shoutout must also be given to Aniyah’s musical number, “Huldey’s Power Ballad”. The performance by the young actress as well as big sparklers and lights, made the ending of the play feel like a concert, leaving us with a song which those of us who saw the show were still singing a week later. Overall, "The Moors" was a dark but enjoyable experience.
