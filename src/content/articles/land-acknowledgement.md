For the last few years there has been a growing trend across the United States and Canada to acknowledge the land and its original inhabitants that communities, schools, and organizations are on today. Local governments, schools, and one of the NHL’s oldest teams, the Montreal Canadiens, have all created their own land acknowledgement statements. However colleges and universities make up a large portion of land acknowledgements, including recently the University of Iowa. So as organizations around the country are issuing land acknowledgement statements what is Cornell College doing?

First let’s back up and understand what a land acknowledgement statement is. A land acknowledgment statement is meant to be a way to reflect on the history and the actions that have happened to Native Americans in a certain area. As the Native Governance Center notes these statements shoudn’t sugar coat details: “Use terms like genocide, ethnic cleansing, stolen land, and forced removal to reflect actions taken by colonizers.” Land Acknowledgement statements are also meant to reflect the local area, referencing the local Native American Tribes and local events. However, they aren’t meant to be only a grim statement rather they should also act as a way to celebrate the Native Americans who live here.

At the moment Cornell does not have its own land acknowledgement statement, however the college is working to make one. It is not clear when Cornell will have it’s statement completed. Several of Iowa’s other major institutions have already issued their own acknowledgements including Grinnell College, Luther College, the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, and Drake University.

While Land Acknowledgement statements are becoming increasingly more common across college campuses it is also a fairly simple action. As the Native Governance Center notes, Land Acknowledgement Statements are “just a starting point” and that “Every moment spent agonizing over land acknowledgment wording is time that could be used to actually support Indigenous people.” All of us can take action.
