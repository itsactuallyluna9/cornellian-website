Imagine hundreds of students in their pajamas rushing into “Bon Appetit” for a free meal two nights before finals. This wonderful sight is called late night breakfast. Late night breakfast is an event taking place on Cornell’s campus that allows for community bonding, and a break from the stress of studying. It is free to all Cornell students and it has happened in the third block and the fifth blocks of this year. The food generally consists of a mixture of breakfast and lunch food including, corn dogs, assorted donuts, tater tots, biscuits and gravy, and more. Adding to the experience is the servers that are faculty which many of Cornell’s students are familiar with. Students share the idea that faculty serving the meal is a tribute to how much they care for the students. The cafeteria is packed full of students, and although the chaos of it all may look or be horrifying to some, it is truly a beautiful showing of the tight knit community at Cornell. Cornell Freshman Sophie Stumbo expresses her love for late night breakfast by stating that it really makes the campus feel like a community and that it is nice to be able to come together and do fun things even when everyone is stressed out.
