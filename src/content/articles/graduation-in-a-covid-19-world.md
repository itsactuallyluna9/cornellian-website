When thinking about graduation there are many questions that come to mind. Will the ceremony be virtual or in-person? How will the ceremony follow COVID-19 protocols? Will family members be able to attend? 

Cornell College has been on top of things this year with its COVID-19 protocols, even being mentioned in the _New York Times_ article on Oct. 26th. The article complimented Cornell’s approach for mitigating COVID cases on campus. The _Times_ article also mentioned the University of Iowa’s “false sense of security” as compared to Cornell’s significant measures to limit exposure and spread. 

Cornell College’s extensive COVID-19 protocols have limited the spread of the virus; there is no doubt that the college will have a plan when it comes to how graduation will look for the Class of 2021. John Harp, Special Assistant to the President, said, “We will make the decision about the format for Commencement 2021 by the beginning of block six.” 

While Cornell has not yet decided on how commencement will be held, Harp further stated that the college has a plan on how to act on the decision. “In advance of the decision, a planning group that includes students will gather feedback on student preference and will examine possible options. As soon as the decision is made, it will be communicated broadly.”

While the safety of students and family members should be of the utmost importance for the college, graduation has always been a monumental occasion in students life, therefore the school should to the best of their efforts try and hold the graduation ceremony in person.
