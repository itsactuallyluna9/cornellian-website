Moving away from home is certainly an adjustment for new college students. With all the excitement of dorm living, you might forget how you’re going to feed yourself if you don’t make it to the dining hall! Cooking in your room can be a bit challenging due to limited space and equipment, but with a little bit of creativity and the right tools, you can prepare simple and tasty meals.

Here are some tips and tricks for cooking in your dorm:

## Remember the Rules!

Remember - Cornell doesn’t allow students to keep microwaves in their dorm rooms! Use the provided microwaves and other large appliances in the common spaces.

Check out the residence hall rules on the Cornell website to make sure you’re up to date and being safe.

## Microwave Meals

A microwave is the perfect way to cook an easy meal in a crunch for time. You can heat up pre-made or leftover meals, make popcorn, and even boil water in a pinch.

I recommend you invest in microwave-safe plates, bowls, and containers so you can avoid any melty mishaps. A good mug is also super handy to boil water with if you don’t have a kettle or saucepan.

## Kettle Time!

Buy an electric kettle! Not only can you make yourself tea or coffee, you can use it to cook instant noodles, oatmeal, or any other just-add-water meals.

If you really want to go all out, check out an electric kettle that comes with a steaming tray - your veggie fix doesn’t always need to require a walk to the dining hall, and frozen dumplings cook beautifully with steam.

## Mini-Fridge Madness

Hopefully you or your roommate came to school with a mini-fridge. These are essential for storing perishable items like milk, yoghurt, and produce. If you prefer to get your dining hall meals to-go, you can keep leftovers chilly in there, too.

If you don’t have a fridge in your dorm room, no worries! There is at least one refrigerator in every dorm, and some have one in the common spaces on each floor.

## No Heat Required

If you’re in a rush, a meal or snack that doesn’t need any cooking is perfect. Keep sandwich fixings on hand to create a tasty, filling meal that you can eat on the go!

Stock up on ready-to-eat snacks like dry cereal, protein and granola bars, crackers, nuts, and fruits. Trail mix is popular for a reason!

## Instant Satisfaction

Instant noodles have gained a reputation of being for broke college kids, but they taste so good, I almost don’t even care. Get a few different brands or flavors; you don’t have to stop at Maruchan. If you’ve got a kettle, boil up some water and pour it over the Ramen; if not, boil your water in a mug in your microwave.

Remember - DON’T PUT STYROFOAM IN THE MICROWAVE! We don’t need any late night fire alarms!

## Clean Up Time!

Be courteous! If you’re using the communal kitchens, remember that other students need access to a clean space to cook up their snacks and meals. Make sure to clean up after yourself promptly to avoid odors and pests. Don’t forget to check your mini-fridge for expired items!
