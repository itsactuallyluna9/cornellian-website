In an unexpected and thoroughly odd turn of events, it seems there is a spirit haunting the cafeteria for the sole purpose of drinking as much of the orange juice as possible. Why this spirit has chosen to consume ridiculous amounts of orange juice specifically is unknown, but bizarre as this may be, you might witness a ghostly figure precariously balancing multiple cups of the substance at a time on their way through the lunch lines. Multiple unfortunate incidents involving the cups crashing to the floor accompanied by a great wail of dismay from the spirit have been reported. Please do not interfere with their process of navigation, however reckless or disastrous. Witnesses are really hoping they learn some common sense at some point, though this grows more unlikely by the day.

If you wish to summon this spirit, you need only speak the words “orange juice” aloud. They will immediately appear with at minimum two full glasses of orange juice in tow, and are perfectly willing to share if you ask nicely and throw in a polite inquiry about the orange juice dispenser’s efficiency today.

Please report any sightings of the Orange Juice Bandit to your local spirit authorities.
