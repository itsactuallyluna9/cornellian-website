After the release of our second podcast episode, “Students Talk About Their FYS Experience,” we invited a few members of our faculty to talk about their experiences teaching the new First Year Seminar (FYS) and their reactions toward the podcast. 

Faculty Members: Professors Erin Davis, Megan Goldberg, Chris Hoklottube, Kate Kauper, Leon Tabak, Craig Teague

While some students look at their FYS experience fondly, others have critiqued it, citing the way it jumped from subject to subject as catching them off-guard. On the flip side, many faculty members feel that one of the sources of students’ gripes surrounding the FYS is a lack of understanding of the true purpose of the class. Students can lose sight of what they are actually learning, especially since it is an introductory course to the Cornell College block system.

Prof. Erin Davis explained that while the content taught in the FYS is certainly important, learning the content is not the main goal of the class. Rather, the goal is to teach students how to learn and to encourage becoming life-long learners. She believes that professors are experts on learning, and this is the most important thing that they impart on first-year students.

The FYS is central to Cornell’s new core curriculum, Ingenuity in Action. While this curriculum has only just been introduced, Prof. Craig Teague described how it has been developed for the past three years, worked on by a vast group of faculty and administration alike. He explained how Ingenuity is meant to be woven throughout the entire Cornell curriculum and continue all the way up until graduation. 

Ingenuity is meant to help further the liberal arts at Cornell. This interwoven curriculum is meant to help tie the disciplines together, rather than viewing them as wholly separate programs. In this way, students are introduced to a wide variety of subjects without veering too far from their major.

**“When will I ever use this?”**

A common concern of students when they take general education requirements, some students claim that they won’t use any kind of humanities, or math, or science, as their major or minor doesn’t factor it in at all. Prof. Kate Kauper understands, but also challenges the notion. She believes that somewhere down the road, students will use the skills taught in their FYS. She refers to this as latent learning. Students may not see the connections between what is being taught to what they plan on doing in the future, but inevitably, a situation will occur where the FYS gave them the tools they needed to deal with it.

When a student enters college, they think they know who they are or what they want to do over the next four years. Students are confident that whatever they plan on studying in undergrad is their true calling.

“We see this in Disney movies. Like Princess Ariel who forgot social norms and decides to be a human and dance with her prince,” Prof. Chris Hoklottube said. “But, no! You are not a singular stable self. There is not a core essential being in you that just needs to be discovered and called out of you. Treat your college experience as a gardener in a garden. You don’t know what’s fully going to thrive in your garden. You kinda know your soil, but you might be surprised on what comes out of it. So the FYS is kind of like putting different seeds on your soil; seeds you may not know about or seeds you may have been resistant to. It might not sprout now, but you might surprise yourself. There is no guarantee that the thing you are proficient in right now is going to be a job in 20 years.”

Many college students switch majors, sometimes more than once. Job-hopping has also been on the rise: people switch jobs due to financial reasons, a not-so-good workplace, personal growth; the list goes on. The pandemic is an epitome of this; people have lost their jobs and were forced to switch gears in order to make ends meet. Faculty claim that the FYS prepares students for times like this.

As for changes, the faculty plans on relying on the data they got from evaluation forms, but they also want to make sure that they are not missing things. They plan on including campus narrative (like the Cornellian) in their decision making. Prof. Megan Goldberg said, “We want to know what the general mood towards the FYS is and how it reflects the data that we have.”

Currently, what has been said in the Cornellian’s second podcast, some of it does not match the data they have. “Is it a narrative problem? Is it a data problem? It’s probably some of both,” said Teague.

Prof. Teague suggested that in the future, faculty need to be more explicit about why they are teaching the course–it’s not all about the content. Rather, it’s how they want students to think. He is confident that faculty can continue to emphasize that theme based on what he saw in the first three iterations of the new, collective FYS. 

As for grading, there is still some difference of opinion among faculty members, but Prof. Leon Tabak hopes to make a case that the FYS should not be a course that is there to solely toughen up students and expose them to the block system at Cornell, but instead give a positive experience. He hopes to have more conversations with his colleagues about this. 

It’s not obvious, but there have been significant differences in grading, how the course was taught, and the content of the FYS from two years ago and this year. Prof. Hoklottube has taught the course twice. During his first year teaching the course, there were instances when he looked at the lesson plan and said, “Not today, Satan.” Some faculty observed how disheartening the course was, which is why they are discussing changes.

As conversations about the collective FYS arise, faculty are willing to listen to what students have to say. Hopefully, the college is able to develop a curriculum where first-year students are able to get a feel of what a liberal arts education is like, and learn how to be successful in 18 days.
