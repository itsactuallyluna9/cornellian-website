Under the heavy curtain of the silenced political campaign “FEED,” tensions have skyrocketed between squirrels rights activists and Cornell’s executive branch. Just last Sunday, swathes of squirrels flooded the lawn of Mr. and Mrs. President Brand, chittering war cries that could be heard from Russell and Pauley-Rorem.

FEED may have drifted into the back of the human peoples’ minds—the elimination of “FEED” from the four iconic windows at the peak of Bowman-Carter delivered a hearty blow to morale—but for the squirrels, it is a call to arms. “Tcktcktck... tcktcktckc. Chrrhhrgg rggg,” said an anonymous participant of the protest. “Tcktck. Chktcktck. Arrr...”

President Brand hasn’t yet released a statement acknowledging the demonstration. Still, the squirrels retain hope for a better future at Cornell College, “Chrhrhg ggar. Tchtchk–arr thcktchk chrhrg, arr tcktcktckhh.”
