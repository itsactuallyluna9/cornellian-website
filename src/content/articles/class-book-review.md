## PHI 261 - Truth, Lies, and Bullshit

### *On Bullshit* - Harry G. Frankfurt

Phi 261 is an interesting class that involves understanding the use of the word “Bullshit” and identifying it in real life. Philosophy is commonly understood as a hard and confusing subject, with many also questioning its value. This class is the perfect example of why philosophy is still relevant, and Professor Jim White makes the complex language of philosophy understandable. This class takes philosophy and brings it together with recent events to show how philosophy is still in use today, and these current events also make understanding the philosophical topics discussed much easier. The use of “Bullshit” is defined by Harry G. Frankfurt in his small and concise book, “On Bullshit” that forms the basis for understanding the course. A modern day philosopher, Frankfurt’s writing can be confusing at times for someone who is unfamiliar with philosophy, but the rest of the course provides all the support needed to understand Frankfurt. Because the book doesn’t describe current events, that actually allows the class to discuss and identify examples of what Frankfurt describes.
