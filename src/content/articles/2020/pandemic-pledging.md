With Cornell’s adaption to COVID-19 policies, a lot of student organizations have been impacted. One important aspect of student-led activities is Greek Life. Of the many sororities and fraternities on campus, a lot of them have been doing online events through Zoom.

But as the semester winds down, some thoughts have turned to pledging for the upcoming year.

One of the most fun activities on campus each year is the Greek Lip Sync during Pledging, which normally takes place over the breaks between blocks five and six. While a fun event, safety is the main concern of campus, evident by the extensive COVID-19 protocols set in place.

Olivia Lennon, Assistant Director of Residence Life and the main contact for Greek Life in the administration, said that all pre-pledge events have been virtual and will continue throughout block five. Student members of the Greek Council were unable to be reached for comment. As an extra precaution and for more rest between pledging and the next block, pledging has been moved to the end of sixth block.

Another advantage of the shift in timeline is the weather. Lennon said, “It may also allow groups to have some events socially distanced outdoors during pledging, if the weather permits.”

Even with the protocols, safety is the priority of the decisions for pledging. “We have yet to coordinate further guidelines for pledging events, such as the lip sync event. Plans for pledging will follow the College’s guidance on safety measures and policies in relation to COVID-19.”

Though campus life seems a bit dull without the constant events and parties that a lot of Greek life throws, they will hopefully resume once the pandemic has quieted down. Until then, feel free to explore and make connections with all of Greek Life.
