*The Cornellian* debuted their new podcast on Nov. 7th with an episode titled “The Political Conversation We Needed.” The podcast can be found on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/2nZWDyfDDDm6rjWxbkFSgX), [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/cornellian), and on *The Cornellian*’s [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TheCornellian/) page, with a new episode being released each block.

In a discussion moderated by *The Cornellian*’s co-Editor-in-Chief Angel Fabila, the podcast displayed the political diversity on Cornell’s campus. Three panelists joined the show: Hemie Collier, Senior Diversity Officer and Director of Intercultural Life; junior Blake Thornton, Chairman of the Cornell College Republicans; and senior Izabella Botto, a representative for Cornell’s chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA).

Their conversation covered a variety of issues including America’s response and global role regarding COVID-19, the Black Lives Matter movement, the Mount Vernon Police Departments’ handling of a hostile political climate, student political expression on campus, and more.

The dialogue began with the panelists describing how their home lives influenced their political views. Despite being politically active as a college student, Thornton says that politics were not regularly discussed in his home outside of presidential election cycles. His political beliefs were more so shaped by the way his parents raised him rather than directly discussing specific issues.

Botto recounts a different upbringing. In her home, where she identified her parents as liberal Democrats, her family welcomed political discussion. With a particular interest in international politics, Botto’s family taught her the importance of inclusivity and how to get along with everyone, regardless of factors like someone’s race or religion.

All three panelists note the impact that college has on many individuals’ political beliefs. Collier remembers being an outspoken Democrat when he was in college, only to question his beliefs while serving as a mock press secretary for a Republican campaign in class. Finding  himself agreeing with some of the policy that the other side of the aisle proposed, he began to value thinking critically about substantive policy issues. Since that class, he has tried to understand the positions of both parties instead of always siding with one over the other.

The podcast spoke to Cornell’s administrative efforts to provide a welcoming  environment for all students on campus. In Collier’s new role as Senior Diversity Officer, he made it clear that a central goal of his new position is to foster a comfortable environment where all students feel that voicing their opinion will be met with decency and respect even when others disagree. He notes that conversing about differing political beliefs is a good thing when people who don’t agree work conscientiously to hear and understand one another.

Implementing an inclusive community culture takes time. Being new to his position, Collier admits that there is work to be done to enhance the welcoming environment for students to express themselves politically.

Botto and Thornton detail some of the challenges that they have encountered while starting student-led political organizations. Botto describes having to be careful with YDSA’s Zoom meeting links because at other colleges, some socialist meetings have been interrupted by unwelcome guests harassing the group. Thornton feels that the College Republicans face additional obstacles because of his group’s ideology when it comes to scheduling meeting spaces on campus.

Collier wants all students to know that they do not have to self-censor. Cornell College is committed to anti-racism, and as long as voicing an opinion isn’t detrimental to others, students are encouraged to speak their minds and attempt to learn from one another by having discourse about their differing ideas.

The Cornellian’s second podcast episode on Dec. 3rd gives a student response to Cornell’s evolving First Year Seminar curriculum. A follow-up article will be posted with faculty members responding to students’ concerns about the required introductory course.
