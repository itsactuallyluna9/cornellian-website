After much deliberation, scientists have concluded that the world we exist in is likely only two dimensions. In the same way the human eye can fill in the gaps of our surroundings such as filling in words when skimming or seeing pictures in the dark, it is now more probable than ever that the three dimensional view is only within the perception of the human eye. In reality, much like the image on a screen, the world is only two dimensional.

 One critic of this discovery claims that “Only idiots and AI would ever come up with this \*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* idea. Serves the government right for defunding education and research. \*\*\*\*.” Supporters of this discovery are calling in to report that since this revelation, they can see in two dimensions. Several of these interviewees were also found to be using questionably recommended medications.

The brain worm leading the health department held a press conference earlier today citing medical records that were disproven— later questioned and never verified— claiming that it is healthier to see in two dimensions. The worm refused to comment to our reporter when questioned on the worm’s allegiances and the lobbies funding the scientists.
