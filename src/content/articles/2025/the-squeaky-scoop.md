There have been an increasing number of reports by students and animals alike of a mafia taking over the Cornell Campus. 

Allegedly, Jermey Nuetz a local collector of human artifacts and side certified bird whisperer, is tied to at least seven squirrel disappearances just last year. Among the missing, Scurly Pecan and Charles Nutmeg just days before their wedding under the tree they met. 

Only one of the seven has actually been found, by an unsuspecting group of college students on their way to town. They came across Oliver Oats, who was deceased on the scene. They created a burial for him with dried leaves and sticks. For a few days after the incident, they passed by to pay their respects. One of the humans has been heard saying, “He looked like he was stuck down during his prime. I really hope the monster who did this is caught.” Another says, “I think he had a wife and kids at home, what a shame.”

Before each of these disappearances, squirrels all over Cornell recall a meeting with Mr. Nuetz a day or two before they are never to be seen again. When asked for a comment, he said, “It’s a shame what happened to those harmed, truly. Yet I have no recollection of being accused of this at all. Do you have the name of the animals saying such things about me?” When approached again on the subject Mr. Nuetz expresses his worry that the council is not looking into the humans. 

Some have speculated that the missing were all in debt to Jeremy. It is known that he loans out enough nuts to last the winter, and all those who have gone missing were financially struggling leading up to the cold months. 

Steve Pun, nicknamed stealthy Steve, is a squirrel from the town of Mount Vernon who has also been spotted with Mr, Nuetz as a partner. It is believed that Mr. Pun has been aiding in the loaning business run by Mr. Neuts. After digging around, a part-time journalist in town that has relocated into Cornell College, Mario Leaf, reveals that there have already been five reported missing, and two found dead. 

Is Jeremy Nuetz taking over the community ecosystem? Will the families of the missing ever find peace? Is Stealthy Steve a mastermind a part of it, or just another pawn to play for Mr. Neutz?Find out more on The Squeaky Scoop Treesite!
