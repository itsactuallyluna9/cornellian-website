Looking for a new distraction? The deceptively simple gameplay of “Balatro” may be exactly what you’re searching for. 

Poker is a fairly simple game, and it’s plenty of fun… for people with enough money to risk it playing cards. “Balatro”, made by the solo developer, LocalThunk, is a deckbuilding roguelike game that lets players bend the rules of the classic card game. The goal is to clear the minimum score (called  a blind) each round by playing poker hands. Increasing your score can be as simple as adding spare cards to your deck, allowing you to play hands that are impossible otherwise, like a full house that’s also a flush, or five of a kind. You also collect unique Joker cards with different effects to improve your score. There are 150 Jokers in the game at the moment, opening up nearly endless combinations and synergies between them, making every run feel different from the last.

With the explanation out of the way, what is it about “Balatro” that makes it so addicting? If you ask me, the combination of simplicity and depth are perfect. Poker isn’t a difficult game to grasp, even less so when you don’t have to play against other people. Meanwhile, the numerous ways to improve your run will have you strategizing to find the best way to clear the next blind. In short, “Balatro” does an excellent job of adding skill to a game of luck. On top of that, the visual and audio effects are incredibly satisfying, so it’ll be pretty clear when you’ve made the right move.

I rate the game at a solid 9/10. The pace of “Balatro” is perfect for when you just want to play something chill or if you’re looking for something to do during a break in class. Best of all, it’ll cost you a lot less than a game of poker. You can get “Balatro” for $15 on Steam or for $10 on the App Store or Google Play. Small disclaimer for anyone buying the mobile version, it might hurt your sleep schedule a bit!
