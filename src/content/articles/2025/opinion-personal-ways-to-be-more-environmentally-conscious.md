It is more important than ever to know the steps we each can personally take to reduce our carbon footprints and be more environmentally conscious in our day to day lives. The following is an assortment of basic options that we consider to be accessible as college students - implementing even one of these into your daily habits and choices will have a positive impact!

## Thrifted Clothes instad of Fast Fashion

Fast fastion clothing is mass-produced and make of cheaper synthetic materials, responsible for toxic wastewater, microplastics that damage the ocean as well as more carbon emissions than cotton, and contributes to wasteful consumer habits (examples of fast fashion clothing companies are Shien, Temu, Romwe, and AliExpress). Many items are made in unsafe, abusive and underpaying factories with the use of child labor. Thrifting is comparable in price but offers the opportunity to affordably discover items of better quality that last for years to come (look in the Goodwill bins!). There are several thrift stores in the area where you can shop sustainably: [The Green Door](https://www.instagram.com/thegreendoor_/) (clothing, jewelry, shoes, antiques; located in the old school building in Mount Vernon within walking distance from campus), [Found + Formed](https://www.instagram.com/foundandformedshop/) (vintage clothing store in Cedar Rapids), as well as Goodwill and Stuff, Etc. (larger chains which have locations in Cedar Rapids, Iowa City, and Coralville).

## Eat Less Meat

Meat is harmful to the environment in many ways. First off, cows produce methane through their burps and farts. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is extremely harmful to the environment becuase it traps hear inside the atmosphere at an even more extreme rate than carbon dioxie. Eating less beef can help reduce the amount of cattle farming. Another major threat to our environment is deforestation because forests are a carbon sink. This means that they absorb more carbon than they release, so destroying them not only puts that stored carbon back into the atmosphere, but also destroys the device that can take that carbon out of the atmosphere. Foods like beef, soy and palm oil contribute to deforestation because they take up forest land. You may be wondering if it is only beef that is bad for the environment: while beef has the mose substantial greenhouse gas emissions, other livestock like prok and poultry are often raised in inhumane ways and processed in facilities that pollute and create runoff which harms nearby land. We are by no means saying that everyone should become a vegetarian right now, we just want to encourage you to begin making the choice a couple times a month, week or day to enjoy plant-based foods instead of meat.

## Drive Less

Cars are harmful to the environment because they emit greenhouse gasses that trap heat inside the atmosphere. Walking, biking, or using public transportation when available can help reduce those emissions. Also, supporting local businesses that are within walking distance is generally better for the environment too because local businesses often produce less waste and emissions than corporations. If able, try walking to local businesses instead of driving to further away chaing. If walking is not an option, driving shorter distances to local businesses is still better. Within a mile of campus there is a grocery store (Gary's), a pharmacy (Mt. Vernon Pharmacy), coffee shops (Fuel & Little Scratch), several restaurants, and much more to meet your needs. We fully understand that sometimes the only option is driving, we just recommend being conscious of when there is an option to choose a local business within walking distance of you.

## Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

Be more conscious of your habits and try to reduce waste. For example, only take the food that you need at Bon App√©tit, and for student organizations ordering catering for events consider quantities carefully so that all the food/drink you have catered gets used at your event! When shopping, pay attention to the packaging of what you are purchasing. Try to buy things that have less wasteful packaging and/or are packaged in materials that can be recycled. Then, make sure to recycle the packages that you can or find creative ways to reuse packaging like using glass bottles/jars as vases. Overall, in any situation where you see the possibility for an excess of waste, think about how to reduce the amount of waste in the future and how to recycle it instead of sending it to a landfill.

These have been some of the individual actions we consider implementing in our daily life to help prolong the life of our planet. If this is new to you, we hope that you will consider taking some of these actions in your own life even if you start samll. If you are someone who already takes actions to prevent climate change, we hope this article sparked some new idead, and we would like to know what else you do! Email us at thecornellian@cornellcollege.edu if you are intrested in sharing the actions you take for our planet.
