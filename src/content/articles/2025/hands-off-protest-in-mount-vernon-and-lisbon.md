On Saturday, April 5th, over a dozen Cornell students joined members from the Mount Vernon and Lisbon communities in a peaceful protest.  The protest – better known as the Hands-Off protest – was one of many advocating for an end to the recent overextension of political power under the Trump administration.  Approximately 260 people from Mount Vernon gathered at the First Street Community Center before walking the 0.7 miles to Lisbon, where the group merged with protestors from Lisbon.  From singing “This Land Is Your Land” to chanting “this is what democracy looks like,” protestors of all different ages and political beliefs became united under a common goal.  

The impact of protests, even those occurring in small rural areas like Mount Vernon and Lisbon, is not to be ignored.  Following the event, Cornell student Orion Pevehouse ‘26 said, “As a history major, I know that protests are a very effective form of dissent, whether it’s three people doing it or three hundred.”  This protest in Mount Vernon and Lisbon exceeded that number with approximately 320 participants, and the protest on Saturday was just one of 1,400 that occurred globally.  With over 600,000 attendees worldwide, the Hands-Off protest is currently the largest display of public resistance against President Trump’s second term.  

As college students, it can oftentimes be difficult to feel heard; this is why enacting the first amendment right to protest can feel incredibly liberating and empowering.  Orion, who took the megaphone and spoke to the crowd at the protest, leaves us with a final message: “I hope that more students will participate in the future!  It’s a good learning experience even if you don’t have a sign or stand up to speak.”
