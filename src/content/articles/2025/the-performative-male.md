Luis Bonilla ‘27 and Sunny Howard ‘27 hosted Cornell’s first Performative Male Contest. Many Rams gathered on the Orange Carpet, carrying the signature tote bag, thrifted fits and a labubu—sometimes a “lafufu”—by their sides. Lined up on the OC, were eight contestants that wanted to dress as a performative male. As an internet phenomenon, this archetype has recently risen in youth cultures. In short, a performative male, well, performs. They sip their matcha latte, read a feminist book, and have one wired headphone plugged in as they look mysterious. Ultimately, they perform a role that is more “stereotypically” feminine with “stereotypically” feminine interests.

But at Cornell, who is actually considered THE Performative Male? As the eight contestants began to perform for the Rams around the carpet, we saw each of them embody this archetype to the fullest. When answering questions from our spectators, the contestants showed their advocacy for feminism. “Get rid of the pink tax!” said one of the contestants. “We should do more events like this so we can show awareness that women matter.” While it seems comedic, in today’s climate, it is more necessary than ever for the Ramily to highlight the issues many of us face.

Yet, as pointed out by one of the spectators, none of the contestants had one of the most important keys to a performative male—a matcha! “I am very disappointed by the Performative Males not having any matcha at all!” said Ignacio Silva ‘28. However, this hiccup did not stop the contest from being heated. After the series of questions, each contestant went head-to-head with one another, looking for the applause that would help them win. As each round of elimination passed by, our Rams were left with Avery Lozano ‘28 and Jose Granados ‘29.

As the spectators cheered one last time for their respective favorites, Bonilla and Howard faced a problem—both were so beloved by the crowd! So they decided this title would be won by a classic game of rock-paper-scissors. The crowd fell silent as the two finalists played. First game in, Lozano won. Second game in, Granados equaled the score. Once again, they were tied. As everyone held their breath for the final game, Lozano played scissors. Granados? He put out a fist—rock. We got a winner—Jose Granados.

But this contest didn’t celebrate just our performative males—it also celebrated the women in their lives—our lives. When asked “Who is your favorite woman?” Granados proudly said his mother. He told us, “She raised me to be the performative male today […] She was that one constant of my life. And I wouldn’t be here without her. So thank you, Mom.”

To pass on the words of Bonilla and Howard, to all of the performative males out there in the Ramily, “Keep performing. We love all the performative males out there that love and support women.” And so do the Rams.
