Since January 20, 2025, there’s uncertainty not only among the American population, but also among college students. In the presidential debate on September 10, 2024, the now president, Donald Trump, mentioned his plans for the term, with threats of “mass deportations.” College students, specifically minority students who were born out of the states, or whose parents are not American citizens but still live in the USA, now worry about their immigration status, and even day-to-day living. Now, not only students are worried about this situation, but also teachers and parents, given that a majority of schools, including colleges, but also elementary, middle and high schools, have sent out an email titled “What to do if ICE shows up?”

This email details how the teachers must react and what protocol they should follow if ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) asks them for information about any student, or faculty. It also details what to do if ICE intends to interrogate, hold, or arrest suspected individuals who are believed to have violated immigration laws. This means that students or individuals can be taken out of the schools, jobs, etc., and brought to an interrogation office, or even jail. According to the Flores Settlement Agreement, a child under 18 years old cannot be detained for more than 20 days in an immigration detention center, even if it’s a family detention. The Immigration Agency is required to hand the child over to a legal guardian, foster care system, or shelters after the 20 days limit is over. The emails share what rights the students have and what the schools will and will not share with this enforcement agency.

Some teachers and professors have even shared and printed out the “Red Card” for some students. The Red Card is a small card that you can carry in your wallet or pocket. This card includes your rights for when encountered with an officer who tries to search you, enter your home, interrogate, or approach you. It is also a card you can give to an officer to invoke your right of remaining silent, and deny permission to enter your home/room unless given a warrant. You can also hand this card to the officer to evoke your rights and make them aware you are familiarized with them.

**So, what should you do if ICE approaches you and interrogates you?**

**Stay calm:** Don’t try to run, argue, or assault an ICE officer.

**Have prepared a wallet, backpack, or purse with all your original legal documents:** The important documents that count as legal are your passport, visa, greencard, driver’s license, social security card, and birth certificate. Put these documents alone in a separate pocket of the bag you are carrying so it is easier for you to reach and so that you have them all together. If your parents are still holding the original copies of your documents back at home, ask them to give them to you, and leave them a copy. Although showing copies of documents are acceptable, you may be held longer until your identity and documentation are corroborated. It is also helpful to memorize any numbers or letters of an official legal document so you can be able to corroborate your identity in case you forgot a document.

**The college faculty is here to help you:** If you feel insecure about the situation, or believe that you cannot carry your documents with you all the time, make copies of your important documents (mentioned above), and give them to a faculty member you trust. Ask your advisor, mentor, or even your favorite professor to see if they are comfortable holding this information with them. If they are not, talk about another alternative or have them recommend you to another resource.

**You have the right to remain silent:** You do not have to respond to any questions asked by the immigration agents. Just say your name if you are asked, and show your papers to demonstrate your legal status if they have a warrant.

**Don’t lie about your legal status:** If you lie about your legal status, that may get you in trouble. Tell the truth, and show your papers if you are asked to show them.

**Memorize an important phone number contact:** Try to memorize your primary/emergency contact number. In case you are detained, or interrogated by an ICE officer, and you are not carrying your documents around to prove your status, memorizing the phone number of someone who can prove your identity or bring your documents can help you get through the process. Remember, even though knowing your parents/relative phone numbers is important, it is essential to memorize the number of someone who can reach your location personally in the shortest time possible.

**Do not sign anything:** If you are asked or given papers to sign, DO NOT! Ask for a lawyer who can go over any legal documents with you, and remain silent.

**Know your safe spaces:** ICE officers cannot come into the classrooms, Allee Chapel, restrooms, and residence halls. These are considered private places on Cornell College’s Campus. Immigration Officers will not be allowed by the college to interrogate, detain, or retrieve any student, faculty or staff personal information without a legal warrant. This is a right that cannot be violated. If it is violated, make sure to note down any information you can: officer’s names, badge numbers, agency details, and any information you can get out of them. You have the right to sue or proceed with legal actions.

The most important facts to take away from this is to remain calm, and carry your documents with you. If you have been through a situation like this, or are afraid of the current situation, you can create a counseling appointment at Ebersole Health and Wellbeing Center. You can also reach out to the Chaplain of the College, Rev. Melea White, at mwhite@cornellcollege.edu, for spiritual guidance. You can also reach out to the writer of this article personally, Maria A. Seda Morales, msedamorales28@cornellcollege.edu, for more information. You can read more about our own college policy on an official email sent by the college President, Mr. Jonathan Brand, on January 29, 2025.

You can print these out, laminate them, and keep them in your wallet, backpack, or pocket. Stay safe out there!
