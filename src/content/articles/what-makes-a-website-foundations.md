> This is the first part of a series focusing on the design and functionality of the Cornellian Website. As such, this article is more technical than others!

## Introduction

So, you *might* have noticed that we have a new website! It has every bell and whistle a "modern" website in 2024 is expected to have (like dark mode, accessibility support, and a copious amount of custom styling), all while being blazingly fast and (theoretically) easy to maintain.

If that's all that intrests you, you can stop reading. If you are curious about how exactly this was put together - whether that be because you want to do something like this for yourself or just want to watch my decent into madness - this is the article for you.

## Planning

In case we haven't met, I'm Luna! I'm KRNL's Co-Station Manager (previously Technical Director) and C4's President.

### Core Design Decisions

At the heart of every programming project, there lies a series of decisions that shape how the project takes form. These could be as simple as "I want to try something new" or "I just need to get this done", but they can get much more complex. (Think of it like a mission statement, or a set of really abstract goals.)

For this website, we decided on the following:
* Be able to host articles and comics
    * (We're not much of a newspaper site otherwise...)
* Be accessible
* Be simple to maintain
* Be fast
* Look cool!
