The establishment that started off as a small shop within a gift store, turned into a bridge for Cornell College students and the Mount Vernon Community. For 20 years, Tommie Ouverson has run Fuel beside her mother, Pat. Before Fuel, Tommie ran a small shop, “Nest” inside a gift store her friend owned. At some point, the owner of the building/gift store was moving out of state, which left Ouverson with a decision of taking up the rest of the store front, or closing her small business. That is when the concept of a coffee shop that also sold merchandise came to life. Ouverson noticed there was no coffee place like the ones she had seen in Minneapolis. With that in mind, she took a step of faith and worked to lay the groundwork for a coffee house. But what set Fuel apart from other places, was the small shop it was built a part of. It created a unique atmosphere and aesthetic to Fuel.

Being one of the only
places in town that regularly offers itself entirely to the community, students flow in and out. The connection of Fuel and Cornell students happened almost instantly, and it was a strong one. Depending on the year, Fuel is the place to be for certain groups of students. One year it could be the theater department they see the most, and the next year it could be the athletes looking forward to the freshly baked cookies coming out the oven.

Whether it is the group of 15 women that come in every Tuesday, small classes held inside of Fuel or the friends of the 70 Cornell College students that have been employed by Fuel over the years, there is a sense of community and feeling of home attached to the place.

> "Fuel is just more authentic than Scooters," says first year Teresa Mejia.

Overson describes, “business is ever changing but it still in some ways is the same shop it was 20 years ago.”

That is one of the differences between Fuel and chain coffee places such as Scooters. Ouverson describes Fuel as “feeling lived in, it’s not a corporate environment”. She states that both businesses just cater to different customers, and that it’s “apples and oranges”.

Scooters has access to convenience with their drive through which does tend to attract highschool students nearby. But even with that, Fuel continues to thrive and provide a place filled with community, love, and support.

With new development about to start on the edge of town, there is some worry of how the town will adjust. But even then, Fuel will continue to do what they are doing and the Cornell community will continue to support them.
