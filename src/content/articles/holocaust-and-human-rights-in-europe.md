Part of the experience of going to college is for students to explore the possibilities of where they want their life to go. They can take art classes, computer science classes, and maybe even a class that they don’t really know the purpose for. There are a variety of clubs to join that loop students in with stickers and snacks. College students are given the space and freedom to choose where their lives may lead, so why not take advantage and go on a trip to explore the world?

During a politics course that took place during Block Two of the 2024-2025 school year, a group of Cornell students and staff set off to learn about human right violations that took place from Berlin to Bosnia. The majority of the course focused on the Holocaust, but it also took some time for students to learn about the Bosnian War that took place in 1992-1995 and resulted in the deaths of about 100,000 people. “There is actual color video of this actually happening… I never learned about the Bosnian genocide in high school. I’m kinda stunned that we didn’t talk about it because it happened so recently,” said Autumn Holmstrom, a junior at Cornell.

The group visited locations of mass murders and the buildings that government officials used to make decisions to further the destruction. These places included concentration camps like Ravensbrook, Sachsenhausen, and Auschwitz, prisons and ghettos like Terezine, and houses like the Wannsee House, where a group of high level officials made the “Final Solution” to the “Jewish problem.” Holstrom stated that “seeing it in person definitely had an effect on me. It made me realize just how widespread the operation was.” Senior Emma Slaymaker agreed, saying “I felt that bearing witness and learning about the struggles and violence that happened during this time was very important.”

Dr. David Yamanishi, chair of the Politics department who has been at Cornell College since 2007, has been offering this course since 2016\. It is offered every other year, taking a brief pause during the pandemic of 2020\.

Yamanishi started to offer this course after helping Dr. Carol Enns (former professor of psychology at Cornell) in her class, “Psychology of the Holocaust.” When Dr. Enns retired, Yamanishi asked if it would be okay for him to start offering a course about the Holocaust as well. From there, the “Holocaust and Human Rights” course took form. “I’ve always believed that visiting these camps was something that everyone should do before this trip, and now that I’ve taken Professor Yamanishi’s class, I can say that statement with absolute certainty of it being true,” said junior Christian Gonzales.

These topics are heavy, and some students even recall moments that they needed to step away. There was no escaping the dark topics of the course, but students also expressed some gratitude for how harshly some of the topics were discussed. Slaymaker observed that “These memorials and museums are not designed to be palatable. They are designed to show the true reality of what happened in Europe during the Holocaust.”

Traveling abroad is not easy by any means, and planning takes a large amount of time, but opportunities like this do not come often. Ingenuity in action credits and funding for off campus courses such as these are available, and the college prioritizes aiding those who have not participated in a study abroad course yet. The funding can go fast, so it is better to apply sooner rather than waiting until the last minute. Cornell does also offer refunds on student meal plans for their months abroad.

Some participants of this course were not taken off the waiting list until the summer, so for those on the waiting list for a study abroad course that they want to take, do not lose hope. They should plan as if they are going anyway: prepare passport information, save up money in the case that a space opens up, and be prepared to make any necessary payments the course requires.

Study abroad opportunities are amazing experiences offered at Cornell College that should not be overlooked. Studying abroad may seem completely out of reach, but the block plan really does allow for more flexibility. “If you’re even thinking about it, like a little bit, you should just go for it,” said Holstrom.
