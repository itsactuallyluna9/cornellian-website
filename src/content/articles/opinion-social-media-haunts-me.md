About a month ago, I made the decision to delete all of my social media apps. The decision came when TikTok got ‘banned’ for about one day. I thought that if the app I used the most wasn’t going to be accessible, I could use this as an opportunity to do a social media cleanse. Even after TikTok became accessible to Americans again, I decided to stay off of it entirely just to complete the detox. 

I had no end-date in mind, it was just something I wanted to do. Quitting social media cold turkey had an immediate effect on how I handled my time. I suddenly was overwhelmed with the nothing that filled up my free time previously used to invest in doom-scrolling. My nights would end in silence, and my mornings went by slower than usual. 

I had to break habits of going onto my phone to search for an app that no longer existed on my screen. I would unlock my phone, opening my social folder that now only held my emails and messaging apps. I would stare, waiting to see what I could click on to pass the time. 

I didn’t get rid of streaming platforms, or even YouTube. I didn’t use them much even when I had social media, and realized that even after I deleted apps like TikTok and Instagram, I still didn’t use them much. Instead I found myself reading a lot more. 

I would consider myself to be a reader, but only for a few months at a time, before I got swept away by my phone and I would forget about the habit altogether. Instead of being on my phone I was reading more and more books. I had time to call home, and even started writing my novel more than I ever had before. I now start my days by reading a chapter, and end my days with a few more.

I found that only now, a month later, I have stopped reaching for the apps. I genuinely feel a difference in how I view my school work, how fast it gets done, and overall how productive my days end up feeling. Boredom finds its way into my life a bit more often than it used to, and I’ve fallen behind on internet references, not that it’s noticeable to anyone but me. But, I’ve gained the ability to find entertainment in everyday tasks. For the first time, in a really long time, I can find the beauty in being bored.
