> “While we are experiencing a return to a mostly-normal experience on campus, it is important to remember that the pandemic is not over, and people will have varying degrees of comfort returning to everyday activity.”

The above quote is from the Cornell College website’s section on COVID-19 response. It implies a sense of hope that normalcy may return but an understanding that things are not normal here on campus. Things on campus have been wild and quite varied recently and that becomes especially clear when looking at COVID-19 rates and policies that change constantly on the hilltop.

Before winter break things seemed to be returning to normalcy not just here on campus but across the United States. Vaccination and booster rates across the country were increasing and it seemed herd immunity may be coming soon, but that is when the Omicron variant started becoming more and more common.

Flights were canceled, mandates were put back in place, and it seemed like March 13th, 2020 all over again. The Omicron variant of COVID-19 took the country by storm and threw everyone back into the uncertainty that the beginning of the pandemic started us in.

Most uncertain were college students and whether or not they would be able to return to campus for a spring semester. Cornell College students were among these uncertain groups and as campuses across the country started putting in stricter guidelines or choosing to begin the semester online students here heard nothing. The only information we got was an email sent on January 4th, 2022 - one week before classes started - stating that we would return to campus.

This email included information on increased COVID-19 protocols and regulations that would be put in place over the upcoming block. These included symptomatic testing and required masking in all campus buildings.

For this article, students were surveyed on their opinions about COVID-19. Students were presented with questions about COVID-19 policies in general and some questions about specific protocols. The Cornellian staff thanks those who participated and hope to do more surveys like this in the future.

Protocols were welcomed by students and our surveys say that 70% of polled students think the COVID-19 protocols in place during block five kept them safe and were supported.

An issue students had with receiving this news was the timing of it. Students were already prepared and worried about traveling back to campus and these plans needed to be made more than a week before classes started. This seems to be a trend when it comes to Cornell and their communication to students about protocols and rules. During those uncertain times, students would have appreciated knowing more sooner even if it was that a decision had not been made yet.

Communication is the key here. Students are concerned and worried about how COVID-19 may affect their college experience and the way to ease this worry is more open and frequent communication with the student body about decisions being made behind closed doors.

Students are also worried about consistency when it comes to the application of COVID-19 policies. When policies are constantly changing without much information being passed around or advertised students don’t know what regulations they should follow or encourage others to follow.

One student said “Cornell needs to learn how to stay consistent with the COVID-19 policies. In other words, have it make sense. I understand this is a day-to-day process,” and this seems to be a common remark when it comes to students and what they know about the COVID-19 policies around campus. With the changing information, they are given in-frequently they do not know what responses they should take to munity. help the overall campus com-

Of surveyed students, 65% do not agree the communication efforts related to COVID-19 updates and protocols are frequent enough. Students would appreciate more communication regarding decisions and stuff that could change around campus. Only 40% of students surveyed agreed that the promotion of COVID-19 protocols was enough. Students think that there should be more programming and advertising of what the current policies regarding COVID-19 are.

Students also want to be more involved when it comes to the decisions that affect them. Currently, on the COVID-19 Task Force, there is one student representative that is to bring all student concerns to the Task Force. Perhaps the solution to this situation is not to open more student representative spots to the COVID-19 Task Force but to have the COVID-19 Task Force be more readily available to students. The COVID-19 Task Force should more regularly update students on decisions they are making and who is making these decisions. Over 70% of surveyed students did not know who was on the COVID-19 Task Force.

Only 30% of surveyed students confidently agreed that they were informed about COVID-19. This number is too low. More students should be informed about COVID-19 especially being now two years into this pandemic. Most of this can probably be chopped up to a need for more self-education among a younger generation, but the college also has a responsibility to educate students on what they need to know. Students would appreciate more informative programming and communication on the way CVOD-19, the vaccine, masks, etc. work.

Students, of course, know the weight that COVID-19 has put on the college for the past two years, and coming up with the current solutions to keeping students safe has to be a hard job, so let us help you out. Students are not just the people you are trying to protect but are the people you should be listening to as well. They are eager to be involved in the decisions being made about their lives and if you will just listen, students will talk.

After a meeting with Lynn O’Brien (Director of Student Health Services), I was able to get plenty of answers for most of the questions and concerns students presented in our survey. In regards to testing, Lynn said that testing is open to anyone who is exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms and anyone who is a positive contact. She also stated that with the Omicron variant COVID-19 testing is best done after symptoms have developed. Testing for the Omicron variant is truly a right now type of testing that only says whether you have COVID-19 not if you may be developing it after being a close contact.

In regards to communication, Lynn presented worries about over-emailing or over-contacting students. This does not line up with what we have heard from students and perhaps needs further digging to figure out what students want and need from communication with the college.

Lastly, Lynn wanted students to know that she “appreciates each and every one of them, they have answered calls, been gracious about isolation and quarantine. I know it’s a miserable experience, but I am so proud of how the student body has handled this.”

It is not my belief that the staff do not want to keep us safe and is not my purpose with this article to tell the staff what they are doing in regards to COVID-19 is wrong. This article is to let the staff know that students on campus do have opinions. Most importantly though, it is to let everyone know that students have a voice and want to be listened to when it comes to decisions that change their daily lives.

To get more information on COVID-19 protocols on campus please check out the Cornell College website or give Lynn a call at (319) 895-4292 or stop by Ebersole Health Center.

As of printing this article the COVID-19 protocols have been updated to reflect a drop in COVID-19 cases on campus. Masking is only required in Cole Library and all academic buildings.
