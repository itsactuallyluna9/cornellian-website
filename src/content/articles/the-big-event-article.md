The Big Event is a Cornell College favorite. It brings the college and Mount Vernon community together to celebrate arts via local artists, and main event performers that students can recognize and love. Laura Sander ‘26, Chair of the Big Event Committee, stated that “the goal is to find an up-and-coming artist who would appeal to the student body and is within our budget.” 

To achieve this, the committee for The Big Event is made up of representatives from KRNL radio station,  Performing Arts and Activities (PAAC), Student Athletes Activities Council (SAAC), Student Senate, and Greek Council. The group put a list together with potential artists that are then given to a contractor at HowToConcerts. Planning the event is a task completed by a large group of people, which takes time to coordinate. “We began planning this event in the beginning of block 2, so it’s nearly been 6 months!” said Sander. 

Costs for The Big Events are split between Student Senate and The Williams Fund. The Williams Fund is how Cornell brings lectures and entertaining events to campus. Richard, Cornell Alumni 1963, and Marlene Williams contribute half of what it cost to bring in one speaker and one performer during the academic school year. Sander shared that “for all smaller events leading up to the actual day, paying the artist, production team, and extra staff help, we spent about 70k for the event.”

Through a new process introduced of audition forms, the openers for The Big Event were Cornell’s Pop/Contemporary Ensemble. The group is formed by a number of students interchanging positions and roles in the band throughout the performance. Notably many students this year were impressed with the work of their lead guitarist, Oskar Diyali ‘27! The set was about an hour long and only moments after, bbno$ started his performance.

The crowd's energy was intense from the start. bbno$ then made it known that he would be giving away a ramen cookbook to the person who gave the most energy throughout the performance. With short breaks in between songs, bbno$ joked around with the crowd about how important education is, having the crowd answer simple math problems adding up to the number 69. Late in the show he also talked about Canada “becoming the 51st state” before covering the song “Party in the USA” by Miley Cyrus.

There were a select few in the audience who were dressed up in costumes, such as a purple Teletubby, a glass of beer, Hatsunemiku and Young Gravy, an artist who collaborated with bbno$ on a song. When spotted by the performer, ‘Young Gravy’ went on stage and performed a few songs alongside the artist. The surprise guest introduced himself as Colby, and when asked to repeat his name, said “Colby, like the cheese.” When recalling the experience, Colby Kerner ‘25, shared that “I've been a big bbno$ fan for the last couple of years, so getting to go on stage was literally a dream come true.”

Overall, the event seemed to be a huge hit for the community! Students continued talking about the event across social media platforms, to their friends, and around campus. Now, the Cornell Community is left in anticipation of who the committee will choose to perform next year.
