Within academia, research is done by reading other people’s resources, doing on-site studies, and conversing with other disciplines on the topic. However, lacking quite frequently from this is the stories and eyewitness accounts from the events that occurred. Combining human stories into research will round out the study by finishing the perspectives.

As a student in college, one is told to discover their own hypothesis, their own thesis, and their own research. The task is daunting and hard to come to terms with. I was faced with this task during my junior thesis class, wondering how new research could be done by just reading other people’s studies. Yet this is where my study came in.

One is usually not told what kind of resources to use or look for in research projects. You are given a topic and told to find the answers. Students often look for quick reads and easy access articles, with little attention to who is writing them and what field they are coming from.

While reading articles on any subject, one will find tables and graphs, charts, and summaries all pointing to the beginning, middle, and end of a problem. Although this will give you a well-rounded understanding of quantum physics, it gives no understanding of the human relationship to history.

One could read on the topics of religion, politics, history, anthropology, and so on and never come across one quote or story from a real person. Although some articles do highlight these stories, it is not as common as they should be.

Research shows that people relate to stories. They relate to what other people have been through and can place themselves in those situations as they discover new things about history. Without these stories, there becomes no connection to the events and learning loses its appeal.

Many people I have worked with, including myself have all done better and understood material more when human stories were incorporated. The reading becomes easier to understand, and I find that there is still room for interpreting other people’s stories.

When I chose to study the Maoist Insurrection in Nepal, a primary source had to be chosen. I chose to use interviews and memoirs as they were witnesses to the events that happened. And while reading them, I came to the realization that these stories were missing from another research.

Previous studies on the topic had clumped Maoists and civilians together. They had generalized the experiences and even compared them to other insurrections around the world. There was little attention to what people went through and how people changed during the decades-long battle.

When I started looking into these stories, gaps in other articles’ history were filled in and I felt that I could understand what happened better. After hours of research and study, I finally understood what I wanted to focus on for my research and had a clear goal. This was done because I used resources from all perspectives, focusing on the human story.

As students progress into creating their own research topics, it is important for them to look at all sides of the story. There is a place for graphs, summaries, and interviews in academic writing. By utilizing as many perspectives as possible, one will find answers quicker and will understand the issue in more depth than if they were to just focus on one kind of article.

Although these strategies should be used in the professional world, it is important for students to begin on this track. If the use of all perspectives is put into place while writing at the college level, the professional academic world will automatically begin to advance.

Professors must guide their students through their research to find perspectives from multiple fields and points of view. This will give the student a more thorough understanding and ability to add their own perspective to the field of knowledge. First-hand accounts should be utilized more in academia because they can connect to more people while also providing historical information.
