## HIS 200 - Public Memory and Public History

### How the Word is Passed - Clint Smith

In How the Word is Passed, author Clint Smith visits sites with historic ties to slavery; in particular slavery museums such as President Jefferson’s home in Monticello. Smith talks to people from all walks of life on tours at these places and to the people who work there to get a better understanding of how the history of slavery is understood in America. Public Memory and Public History is focused on how people understand slavery and how public history teaches slavery. Places like museums that Smith visits are part of public history and because publisc education is how many adults will learn more about history it is important to understand what is happening in public history to better present American history as more than just White history. Smith’s book is the key focus of the class and everything done in the class is tied back to Smith’s book and helps students understand the importance of public education and how little representation black history has in most American’s educations.

## EDU 205 - Historical Foundations of Education

### The Education of Little Tree - Asa Earl Carter

The Education of Little Tree is an interesting book about a part White, part Native American boy who is raised by his grandparents. The novel allows a class to talk about the racial prejudice in America as well as the ways that Native American children were mistreated in schools designed to separate them from their families and cultures to “civilize them.” This book is also unique because the author, Asa Earl Carter was a KKK Organizer and segregation activist; this fact allows a class to talk about the interesting dichotomy of an author who is part of the KKK who writes a story that presents a sympathetic view of Native Americans. Additionally, the class focuses on black education in the United States and how barriers to education were systematically created to prevent black education after slavery; made all the more poignant when considering the identity of the author for this book.
