As most of you probably know by now, Scrug Bluxter has indeed been indicted. He’s nasty. This much we know, from the coffee pools under his door in Smith, AND under his door in Olin. But it is now official - Cornell’s backup president Croxley Crueger has posted his indictment letter on the TC doors.

When interviewed, President Brand had this to say:

> “This is President Jonathan Brand.”

While we are not yet sure what these two crimes are, a poll of 400 Cornellian students had yielded the following guesses:

* Nasty Tennis[^1] (96 votes)
* Urinal art (86 votes)
* “Flaxxing” (54 votes)
* Being a Bad Sport (53 votes)
* Being ‘just so nasty’ at public
* funerals (41 votes)
* Kicking Fungle the Clown [the OC’s mascot] (22 votes)
* Kissing Fungle the Clown
* (22 votes)
* Touched the salmon bucket
* (21 votes)
* Filthy Tennis[^2] (5 votes)

As of yet, there is no evidence that Scrug has been taken into custody, judging by the flow of coffee under his door in Russell. We knocked, but he didn’t come out. Little rat. I think he should be buried alive without food or water. Little rat.
