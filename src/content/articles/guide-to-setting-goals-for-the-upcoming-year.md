“New Year, New Me.” We hear it every year. At some point every person has fallen into the traps of wanting to start all new healthy habits at the same time. Motivation comes strong, but definitely wears off fast. Collectively, it can be really difficult to even choose what goals to focus on. For the new year to come, here are some ideas and tips to help people keep up with their goals.

## Start Small

Change is either a thing that is fast and unexpected or slow and unbearable. People tend to forget this when they choose a goal that calls for drastic change right away. It’s easy to expect to feel the results of hard work right away, then get discouraged when the results don’t appear. To prepare for this, really take time to remember the amount of effort that was put in when trying to do the bare minimum.

A good example of this is trying to journal daily. In order to keep the momentum, choose the absolute minimum possible and have that be the goal. If it is easier to journal only a page, paragraph, or even sentence, focus on that. There is nothing stopping a person from doing more than what their minimum is, but it helps create the sense of progress.

## Progress is a Mental Game

A lot of those who lose the confidence or motivation to keep going often describe the reason for quitting to be the stress that comes without feeling progress. Daily affirmations can aid in the feeling that things are not moving forward. If something physical that is visible and can be tracked works better then some possible strategies like marking days on a calendar or a checklist will provide a physical representation of how long a person has been working towards their goals.

## Change is Relative

Every person on this Earth lives and experiences differently. For a significant other, getting up in the morning might come naturally, or an aunt at a family gathering might have trouble reading the room when others believe it’s obvious. These are all very important things to keep in mind when sharing progress with others. They might not realize how big of a change it is for someone to make their bed every morning, or have a full skin care routine before calling it a night. Despite comments that people will make, good or bad, the important thing for each person to focus on is how they feel through it all. To make an effort to be proud of themselves.

Making and working towards goals do not have to start on January 1st. Achieving and reaching goals is not easy or simple, so whether someone starts on January 1st or tomorrow, it is important to stay positive.
