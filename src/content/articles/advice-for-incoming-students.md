Being at Cornell can be confusing sometimes, especially for first-year students. As someone who has been through it, these are some of my takeaways from my time here:

## Ingenuity In Action

Everything you need to do for Ingenuity in Action (InAct) can be overwhelming. You need two of them to graduate; the sooner you can get them done, the less you have to think about them. Start by going to the InAct page on the Cornell website and checking out the list of pre-approved activities. You can do something that isn’t on the list, but it’s likely you’re already doing something that is pre-approved. If you want to do something that is not on the pre-approved list, you will need to write a proposal to get it approved.

Once you’re about to start your activity, go to the InAct Participation page, find ‘Complete the Proposal,’ and click on the link to the InAct Portal. Go to ‘Other’ and click ‘Apply for an activity.’ From there, fill out the information. Throughout your activity, keep track of your hours and what you do. At the end, you will have to answer some questions about your experience. You have two weeks after the activity wraps up to fill out these questions and submit them to your staff sponsor.

I cannot stress it enough: the sooner you get this out of the way, the better you feel.

## Clubs and Organizations

There are a bunch of clubs and organizations on campus that cater to a wide range of interests. I highly recommend checking them out and joining one or two if possible. It’s a great way to meet people and feel like you’re a part of the community. By joining clubs, you help shape what events happen on campus.

When you pay your tuition, you pay an activity fee. That money goes directly into clubs. You are paying for these clubs to exist and hold events, so you may as well participate in them.

## Study Spaces on and off Campus

As someone who struggles to leave their room for more than just food and class, it took me a while to discover some great places to study on campus. Zamora’s Lounge is a great place to go, especially if you have an awkward amount of time between classes or meetings. Zams has good food, good drinks, and plenty of snacks! Cole Library is full of great places to go on almost every floor. My personal favorite is the desks in the stacks on the second floor.

## Downtown Mt. Vernon

Downtown Mt. Vernon is filled with great places to check out. Fuel is a cozy coffee shop with delicious drinks that every Cornell student should visit at least once. Bigs BBQ has savory and mouth-watering barbeque that Cornell students can get a discount on every Wednesday night. The Bijou movie theater is an excellent place for organizations or groups to hold movie nights. Gary’s - even though it isn’t necessarily in downtown Mt. Vernon - is a great spot to get your groceries.

If you keep going down First Street, there are some great antique stores and the old middle school that is now full of businesses such as an antique store, a hairdresser, fabric stores, and more. Even further down is a large pond surrounded by short trails that are lovely to walk around when the weather is warm.

Cornell College is in a wonderful town that has a lot to offer. It’s essential to take advantage of that while you’re here.
