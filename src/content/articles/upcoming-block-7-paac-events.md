The return from spring break will bring exciting events to campus hosted by PAAC for block 7. Students can look forward to the return of stuff a critter during block 7, and expect the line to be as long as usual. Make sure to line up early since those critters can get snatched up in a heartbeat. PAAC has already decided on what furry little friends will be on the tables down on the orange carpet, but the details of what they will be are confidential and being kept as a classified surprise. One plush has been chosen for the stuff a critter that has yet to make an appearance at the event so far, so there is no cause for concern over duplicates bogging down a collection. Stay on the lookout for more information on stuff a critter’s return during block 7.

Along with Stuff a Critter, PAAC is hosting a few other exciting events. that is not the only event in the works. A performance by poet and spoken word artist Ashlee Haze is also on the horizon for block 7. With over a decade of poetry experience and a 2023 Silver Telly Award for her original voiceover, she will surely put on a memorable performance. As one of Atlanta’s premier word artists, Haze is one of the most prominent voices in slam poetry. Her viral poem “For Colored Girls Who Don’t Need Katy Perry when Missy Elliott is Enough” is a poem of representation in media and a bold declaration of authenticity. There will be more information on when Ashlee Haze will be performing coming out during block 7.

These two events were the highlight of the last PAAC meeting, but that does not mean they are the only activities planned. Official dates, times, and event locations will be publicly released as the events draw closer.
