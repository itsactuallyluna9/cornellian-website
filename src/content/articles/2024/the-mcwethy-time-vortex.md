Today we are saddened to report the most recent mysterious disappearance of an art student to the depths of McWethy Hall. Seven students have tragically been lost in McWethy to date, taken seemingly at random as they work on projects in the art building until all hours of the night. This strange phenomenon, commonly believed to be a time vortex, is the nemesis of Cornell College art students. Even setting aside the extreme cases of these disappearances, many students report losing precious hours to this force. In one instance, a student, who has requested to remain anonymous, stayed back to work after class ended at three o’clock and thought they’d worked for approximately an hour - but upon exiting McWethy, they discovered it was past midnight!

Rumors have run rampant across campus over the years since the first disappearance, yet no one seems to have seen this supposed “time vortex” itself - or at least, lived to tell the tale. Of course, all manner of unsettling noises can be heard from the walls or ceiling of any classroom, and we suspect these indicate the time vortex activating. All that we know is that it will strike again, so enter McWethy at your own risk!
