The Fall Kimmel Theatre mainstage production, Body Convos, explored the insecurities we all face about how we look, and instead of viewing them negatively, finds the beauty in our bodies through dance. The show opened with a beautifully chaotic number, the dancers beginning in a circle together before breaking off and each doing their own choreography. The different styles came together to create a busy stage of movement, each telling their own story in their solo dancing. The performance to “Dance, Dance, Dance” by Lykke Li, was undeniably fun. The dancers all dressed in rainbow, moved to the beat of the song, showing an air of confidence from dancing, as the song likewise suggested. Throughout the show, there were also small group dances, choreographed by the dancers themselves. From the powerful movement in the number to “Fall in Line” by Christina Aguilera to the modern funkiness displayed in the “Interdimensional” by Cosmo Sheldrake dance to the soft contemporary styles of the trio to “How I’m feeling Now” by Lewis Capaldi and the solo to “Space Song” by Beach House, you could feel and see the passion these dancers put into their craft and all the hours they spent rehearsing over the last block. Body Convos closed with one last group number conveying a sense of camaraderie among the group. The lights came up on subtle but sweet partnering only to evolve into a synchronized dance involving everyone in the show. The use of choreography from previous numbers brought the show together and wrapped it up beautifully.

In between each of the dances a prerecorded video played, displaying more dancing of those involved with the production of Body Convos, though in a more informal setting, the dance studio. These videos contained voiceovers about different insecurities, whether it be how they look, weight, or feel. But despite these self-doubts, they dance. The last tape came to the conclusion that we all will have off days with how we are, but that doesn’t mean anything is wrong with us or we have to change, an important lesson for everyone, especially those at the college age, who are always thinking about how they are viewed. The videos were extremely influential in getting the message of the show across to everyone in the audience.

Kudos must also be given to the costume design team who made some of the costumes seen on stage themselves. As someone who has no sewing abilities, I can only imagine the amount of effort that must have been put into the looks the performers wore. From the chained shirts in “Fall in Line” to the wildly differing costumes in “Interdimensional” and the delicate, flowy skirts in “How I’m Feeling Now”, each dance had a different vibe, and that is in part due to the costumes.
