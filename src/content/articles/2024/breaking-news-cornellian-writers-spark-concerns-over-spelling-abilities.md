A peculiar fenomenon has taken center stage on the campus of Cornell Unviersity College: the writers of the esteemed Cornellian are under fire for their seemingly horryfing grasp of the English language. What began as a routine publication quickly turned into a spelling bee gone wrong.

First, there were the heablines that seemed to have undergone a collapsse, levaing readers scratching their heads in confusion:”Zame’s Nes Shceduel” one headline read, while another boldly proclaimed, “Tiny Babes Take Over Cole Libraerie“

It was as if the spell checker has taken a vacation, leaving chaous in its wake.

From there, the sichuashon only worsened. Articles intended to inform and enlighten devolved into unintentional comedy. From tales of “paranomral activity” haunting McWethy Hall to an exposé on the “librarry’s” book shelving dilemma, it seemed no corner of the school was safe from the writers’ linguistic misadventures. 

In a desperate attempt to salvage their reputation, the Corneillian hastily organized a spelling boot camp, led by the resident grammar guru, Ms. Dora the Explorar. Yet, even under her vigilant eye, the writers stumbled over words like “accomodation” and “maitenence,”. 

Despite their valiant efforts, the next issue of the school paper arrived with mixed reviews.
