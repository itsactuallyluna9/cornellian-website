While many students were off enjoying their time away from campus this spring break, a great and monumental battle took place on the campus grounds. Due to the short winter, the annual squirrel revolution began earlier than anticipated. The squirrels dug up their cartoonishly small armaments throughout the campus and began their siege on Cornell to usurp President Brand and overthrow Ulysses the Ram to become the school’s new mascot. Recruiting the bats in Bowman Carter, the squirrels were able to perform night operations and deploy their troops all across the campus rooftops to rain down righteous fury upon their targets. Specifically in the manner of tossing the acorns they had burrowed away during the fall semester.

This rodent rampage would have persisted had it not been for the exceptional timing of Iowa’s weather. Because Iowa’s weather has the consistency of a middle schooler’s first fanfiction, the squirrels were unprepared for the sudden spike in temperature into the low 70s over spring break. With their morale broken, the squirrels signed a peace treaty with President Brand. Being that the squirrels cannot speak or read English, they will attempt another coup next year. Until then, the students and staff are free to go about their daily routines in peace.
