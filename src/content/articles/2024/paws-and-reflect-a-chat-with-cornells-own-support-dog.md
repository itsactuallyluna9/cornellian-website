In an exclusive interview, I had the privilege of sitting down with Bailey, a lovable lab mix who is making a big impact on the mental and emotional health of Cornell students. Sit down with us as this four-legged counselor and her awesome owner, Karla, share their insights on how Bailey brings comfort and joy to those in need.

**Q: Bailey, tell us a little about yourself. How did you become a campus support dog?**

*Bailey:* Woof! I’m Bailey, but my full name is George Bailey Christmas Miracle. My mom brought me home Christmas of 2017 when I was 9 months old. Now I’m 7 years old. I’ve been a people-loving, empathetic pup from the start. My mom started bringing me to work with her almost immediately when she started counseling here. She knows I do really well with strangers and I get lonely when I’m home by myself all the time.

**Q: Did you undergo any type of training to get where you are, or are you just a naturally good dog?**

*Bailey:* When I was a puppy, I aced my obedience training. I don’t have any certifications, so I’m not an official therapy dog, but my mom knows I’ve got what I need to spread love on campus.

**Q: In your opinion, how does your presence positively impact the college community?**

*Bailey:* Students need a place that feels like home! When students talk about wanting to go home they are often talking about missing their beloved pets. As much as my mom and her colleagues can try to warm up the space with lights and decor, but a dog is what makes a house a home. I also make talking with counselors easier! I am so attentive to the conversation, maintaining eye contact and laying at the students feet if I sense they are upset.

**Q: How do you handle stress or challenging situations while on duty?**

*Bailey:* I generally don’t get stressed or anxious unless there are fireworks or thunder. When my mom brought me everyday, I started to see Ebersole as my pack and got protective of the counseling staff, so I had to start staying home some days. Every day is too much for me and too much for mom.

**Q: Can you describe a typical day in the life of a college support dog?**

*Bailey:* When my mom turns onto the street that leads to campus, my ears perk up. I drag her up the hill to Ebersole by my leash so I can race around the halls and do my visitation rounds. I greet Miriam first (she’s got gourmet treats especially for me), then I move to Karen and Lynn. Sometimes students come in specifically to see me and I get to play fetch with my bone in the hallway! During counseling sessions, I sit across from the student and listen intently, cuddling up at their feet if they seem distressed.

**Q: Do you have a favorite spot on campus or in the health center, and why?**
*Bailey:* In Ebersole, I love to have free reign of the place! I love to cuddle up on my chair or the pillows in my mom’s office. When my mom’s human children are in town, I get to go running on campus, but my main haunt is Ebersole - it’s basically an extension of my home. I love to pop up and surprise people when they ring the bell at the front desk.

**Q: Lastly, what’s your favorite part about being a campus support dog?**

*Bailey:* Woof, there are so many great things about it! The treats are a highlight, but the best part is making people happy. It’s heartwarming to see their reactions when I walk in and knowing that I can bring comfort and joy to their lives. That’s what being a dog is all about. My mom says her favorite part is watching people light up when they see me. We love hearing “can you bring her everyday?”

Bailey’s dedication to spreading love and support to those in need truly warms the heart. This furry counselor is a shining example of how our four-legged friends can make a significant impact in the world of therapy and emotional healing and how important animal support is for college students.
