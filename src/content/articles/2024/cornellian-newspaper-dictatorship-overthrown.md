For the past four years, the Cornellian Newspaper has been under a dictatorship. There seemed to be no end to the stagnant executive board’s reign. The staff made strides in May of 2023 when they were able to overthrow one of the Co-Editor-in-Chiefs, Donivan Jones.

After a year of attempted coups, the Cornellian staff has successfully begun the forceful removal of the final executive board members: Grace Anderson, Editor-in-Chief; Izzy Schmidt, Business Manager; and Jack Scodro, Senior Writer. We asked each executive board member for their comments on the situation. Scodro, the most recent addition to the executive board, said: “Thank god, I don’t know how I got here.” Schmidt, who was involved in many other corrupt groups, said: “I’m taking the crossword puzzles with me.” Anderson, the board’s most senior member, said: “I was planning to retire anyway.” We asked staff to confirm Anderson’s comment; they claimed she was lying.
