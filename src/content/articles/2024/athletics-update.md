## Rams Fall Athletics Roundup

The Rams had a strong start to the 2024-2025 school year with Fall Athletics, having multi- ple Team Conference Champions, Conference Team nominations, and a NCAA Championship Qualifier.

The cross country team had an extremely successful season, the men’s team becoming Mid- west Conference Champions with the top seven runners all placing in the top twenty at the meet. Isaac VanWestrienen had an especially exemplary season. With a time of 24:15, he set a school and course record, and became the individu- al conference champion. He also placed fourth at the regional meet to qualify for the NCAA Division III Championship. The women’s team also had success, placing fourth in the conference. Alyza Koppes had individual success, achieving All-Conference (along with Lidia Dahlman) and All-Region status.

The volleyball team had an amazing season, finishing their season with a 19-12 record and be- coming the Midwest Conference champions after an undefeated reg- ular conference season. Both Ilah Perez-Johnson and Clare Green walked away part of the All-Region Team. Perez-Johnson also was se- lected to the All-American Second Team, making her the only player in Cornell’s volleyball program to achieve this honor three times.

The football team had a season of ups and downs, finishing with a 5-5 record. Tony Gomez had a great season personally. He achieved All-Conference First Team in both punter and running back positions. In the game against Grinnell College, he had an out- standing performance, scoring four touchdowns and rushing 207 yards. The team also had two play- ers make All-Conference Second Team: John Smith at quarterback and Devin Quirarte at offensive line.

The women’s tennis team had a great season, finishing 8-3. The #3 Doubles team also took second in the Conference Champi- onship. The team had six All-Con- ference Team honors across four players, the most the team has had in almost two decades.

The soccer teams had rough seasons this year, the men’s team finishing 4-12-1 and the women’s team ending with a 2-13-1 record. They still had plenty of season high- lights, the women’s team having five All-District team nominations and earning the Midwest Confer- ence Team Sportsmanship award. The men also had an All-Dis- trict Nomination in midfielder and forward, Sam Burmeister.

## Winter Sports Season to Date

The men’s wrestling team has had a great start. Coming into the season, they were ranked 24th, with four individuals in the top 15 rankings (Cael Mc- Laren, Treyton Steffen, Jackson Brinker, and Landon Card). They had an outstanding performance at the Millikin Open, having 11 placeholders and three champi- ons (Jase Van Pelt, Brian Petry, and Cael McLaren). They also had a dominating win in their dual against Simpson, winning 49-0. These wrestlers are potentially looking at a very successful season.

Women’s wrestling is a new sport at Cornell, only in its second year as an official team. In the past year, the number of wom- en on the team has tripled. Though they’ve had a rough start to the season, the newcomers show lots of potential, as seen in their first tournament, where most won matches. Jasmine McCaskel spe- cifically shows great promise, win- ning three matches at their open- ing tournament and being the only woman to win against Wartburg.

The men’s basketball team already has a winning record of 6-2. They had a nail-biting path to win- ning the Buzz Levick Classic, go- ing to overtime two nights in a row. The team has also had outstanding individual performances lead- ing them to victory, from Jayden Meeker scoring 25 points against Eureka College to Nate Jacobson scoring a 3-pointer at the buzzer to beat Coe College. Senior Zach Ingle has also had a great start to the sea- son, scoring his 1000th career point.

The women’s basketball team is just getting started, with a record of 5-3, winning their last two games after losing at the Cornell Classic. Freshman Erin Knowles made a splash into the college basketball scene, scor- ing 26 points and pulling down 18 rebounds in her debut game. Though the team has had some tough losses, they show prom- ise of a great season, especial- ly after their 88-23 Thanksgiv- ing win over Northland College. The dance team competed at the Iowa State Dance and Drill Team Association State Compe- tition. They have been practicing for months and performing at the football team’s home games to prepare for the competition. They were runner up in DII/DIII Pom.
