The continuing legacy of _The Cornellian_ was celebrated as part of this year’s homecoming festivities with a retrospective event for the newspaper held at Cole Library on Saturday, October 5th. Former editors, staff writers, photographers, contributors, and enthusiasts of _The Cornellian_ gathered to explore newspaper pages selected from across the decades, share stories about their time at Cornell and with the newspaper, and witness a display on how the newspaper has evolved over the years. The featured pages were grouped in categories such as academic issues, the arts, campus news and events, comics, visitors to campus, social issues and student protests, awards and honors, and more.

To review these pages of _The Cornellian_ is to step back into specific and momentous occasions in the history of Cornell College. Articles and photographs documenting the construction and opening of Cole Library in the 1950s, for example, were among pages displayed in the campus news and events category. Additionally, several of the articles relating to academic issues reported on the initial adoption of the block plan at Cornell in the late 1970s and investigated the faculty and students’ responses to its implementation. Today, the block plan is an intrinsic part of this college, and is cited as one of the primary reasons many students choose to attend Cornell. Its origin story (as well as those of central campus buildings like Cole Library) was recorded in real time by the dedicated students writing for _The Cornellian_.

Returning alumni reminisced about staying hard at work in the old newspaper office \- which at one time was in Thomas Commons \- until midnight and three o’clock in the morning. The students were finishing the editing and formatting for the latest edition, developing film photographs for the paper in the darkroom, and working on the individual articles and editions they were most proud to have contributed to during their years on the newspaper. This retrospective provided a meaningful opportunity to engage with the history of _The Cornellian_ and, through its lens, Cornell College as a whole.
