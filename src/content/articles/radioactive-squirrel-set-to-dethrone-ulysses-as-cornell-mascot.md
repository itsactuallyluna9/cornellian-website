In July of 2020, multiple staff members of the Russell D. Cole Library reported squirrel activity deemed as “highly unusual.”  The squirrel in question (pictured here) was seen to have been drinking water from Ink Pond, which is known by many as radioactive.  Having ignored the sign reading “Do Not Enter For Any Reason,” the squirrel allegedly drank from the pond up to “fifteen times a day,” massively increasing in size with each gallon of liquid consumed.  At the time of the squirrel’s last sighting (August 9th, 2020), it was approximately 3 feet in height, likely weighing about 80 pounds.

August 10th marked a historic day on campus when a derecho devastated much of the midwestern United States and caused irreparable damage to our very own King Chapel, which has been under construction to this day.  Claims of investigative work and funding challenges have done little to ease the concerns of Cornell students, as the lack of visible construction in addition to reported “chattering” heard from within the chapel at odd hours leaves more questions than answers.

“I think [the construction] is a cover-up,” one student, wishing to remain anonymous, claimed in an interview.  “Everybody knows that that squirrel is bulking.  And President Brand’s been wanting to get rid of Ulysses for a while now….”  The student is referring to a recent scandal in which President Brand’s emails were leaked, revealing his long held hatred towards the mascot.  “I mean, a ram?  Seriously?” he wrote to one of the architects hired to work in the chapel.  “What kind of a joke is that?”

As mascot of Cornell College since 1948, Ulysses has never been challenged, yet the large squirrel population on campus makes for an interesting rivalry.  The radioactive squirrel, now estimated to weigh about 200 pounds, is nearly ready to bring its dreams of being mascot to fruition.  As the 2024-2025 school year comes to a close, students fear what will become of Ulysses, who now hides his face in shame at every sporting event.  President Brand has declined to comment.
